# Contributing to Chef Automate

Thank you for your interest in Chef Automate!  We use **GitHub Issues**
for issue tracking and contributions:

1. Reporting an issue or making a feature request
2. Submitting patches for new features or bug fixes

We follow a process used by other Chef
products: <https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>

## Submitting Patches

All patches should be submitted as GitHub pull requests:

1. Make changes on a branch, ensuring to add the [Developer Certificate
   of Origin sign-off](https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-certification-of-origin-dco) to your commits.

2. Create a GitHub Pull Request.

3. Ensure your pull request passes all automated tests. If a test in
   the verify_private pipeline fails and you are not a Chef employee,
   a Chef employee assigned to review the PR will help get the test
   passing.

3. Respond to code review comments to improve the code until it is
   approved to merge.
