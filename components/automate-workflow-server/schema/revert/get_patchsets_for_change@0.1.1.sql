COMMENT ON FUNCTION get_patchsets_for_change(p_change_id changes.id%TYPE) IS
$$Returns the patchsets available for a given change, respecting the
status of that change; please call this function in favor of directly
SELECTing from the patchsets table.

If the change has been merged, then the Git branches supporting all
but the final patchset (the one that was finally merged) will have
been deleted; thus, we only return the single, final patchset record
for such a change. (Were we to do otherwise, we would ultimately try
to retrieve information from the project's Git repository on branches
that no longer exist, which would be bad.)

For changes that remain open, we return all patchset information,
ordered in reverse sequence-number order (that is, the most recent
patchset is first).

We treat 'withdrawn' changes as being gone from the Git repository
entirely. Thus, we return no patchset records, even though they exist
in the database.
