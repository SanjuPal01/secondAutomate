COMMENT ON VIEW open_changes IS
$$Shows only open changes. All closed and withdrawn changes are filtered
out. These are the *active* changes only!

This is the same as the changes table (modulo the above filtering) but
with enterprise, organization, and project IDs embedded in the
resultset. You can use these to filter (or not!) by enterprise,
organization, or project (and various subsets thereof).
