COMMENT ON FUNCTION current_pipeline_status_for_enterprise(p_enterprise_name enterprises.name%TYPE) IS
$$This function aims to return a set of changes similar to a 'Unix
Top' report; more specifically, it returns:
  * the 0-3 latest changes in URD, whatever their status. It does not
    consider previous changes, as those have been supplanted
  * for each pipeline, the latest undelivered changes for build and
    acceptance (same idea as above, it does not consider previous changes)
  * all the unmerged changes in verify
