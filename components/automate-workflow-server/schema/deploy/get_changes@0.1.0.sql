  -- ...
  -- Oh, hello!
  -- I didn't see you there...
  --
  -- The approach here is to find only information about changes
  -- (nothing about patchsets here) that correspond to our search
  -- criteria. We're not returning patchset information also here
  -- because that would make for some gnarly resultsets, with lots of
  -- duplicated change information, and more processing on the
  -- application side to properly partition things.
  --
  -- The data returned does not correspond to any existing table, as
  -- it is all textual information (i.e., no database IDs) drawn from
  -- multiple tables, and corresponding to the "top level" change data
  -- that we return for our API (just take a look at the RETURN type
  -- of this function if you're curious!)
  --
  -- On a technical level, we're using a WITH query to set up some
  -- base relations (or CTE - Common Table Expressions) from which to
  -- draw this information. Because the structure of the query will
  -- change according to the search and sorting criteria, it must be
  -- dynamically constructed.
  --
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -- ALTERNATIVE IMPLEMENTATION IDEAS
  --
  -- If we need to switch things up a bit in the future, there are a
  -- couple other approaches to retrieving this data that we could
  -- take (pretty much in order of preference / impact):
  --
  -- 1) Consider re-ordering / re-formulating the CTEs
  --    It may be better to fold the `all_changes` selection criteria
  --    into the `first_patchsets` CTE, since that will provide more
  --    selectivity, thus reducing the amount of data we are working
  --    with.
  --
  --    (In fact, I may just do this anyway, once I get some tests set up)
  -- 2) Extract the latest / first changeset logic into views
  --    This could be useful if we have a need for accessing these
  --    things elsewhere.
  -- 3) Change the schema of the changes table
  --    Duplicate the submission data in the changes table when it is
  --    initially created. Set up a trigger that updates status as new
  --    patchsets come in. Or simply store references to the first and
  --    latest patchsets directly. This would put all the change data
  --    into the change table itself, and would simplify this query a
  --    good bit.
  -- 4) Don't use CTEs
  --    I think this query could be formulated without using CTEs
  --    relatively straightforwardly. Just use embedded subqueries.
  --
  --    I wouldn't necessarily jump to #4, though, unless you just
  --    HAVE to squeeze every last bit of performance out of this
  --    query, and *nothing else works*. The optimization hit that we
  --    might take with a CTE is perhaps less important than having a
  --    query that is readable and comprehensible to mere
  --    mortals. This is dynamically-generated SQL, so it's already a
  --    little hairy, what with all the quoting and concatenation;
  --    let's not make it worse unless we ABSOLUTELY (and provably)
  --    need to.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  -- CTE #1: all_changes
  --
  -- The first CTE, `all_changes`, narrows the scope to only those
  -- changes that are from the specified project, optionally narrowed
  -- down further to changes from a specific pipeline. No date
  -- information is used here; this is *all* changes.

  -- CTE #3: first_patchsets
  --
  -- Finally, in order to determine both when the change was submitted
  -- and who submitted it, we need to look at the first patchset of
  -- each change. This is more straightforward than finding the latest
  -- patchset, since all changes are guaranteed to have a patchset #1
  -- :)

  -- If we were given a change ID, then we're looking for changes
  -- submitted before / after it, according to our sort order, so we
  -- filter on the submission timestamp. We do this, rather than use
  -- the OFFSET operator, because the latter is inefficient when used
  -- with large values (the server still has to compute all the rows
  -- it will eventually skip). It's better to not even consider in the
  -- first place all the rows you'll skip. See
  -- http://use-the-index-luke.com/no-offset for a technical
  -- discussion of this approach.
  --
  -- Note that there is a vanishingly small chance that two changes
  -- may have been submitted across all the pipelines of a given
  -- project at the exact same moment in time (down to PostgreSQL's
  -- microsecond resolution, at least). In that case, they will have
  -- identical timestamps, and it is possible that one (or more, if
  -- you're just astoundingly fortunate!) change would never appear in
  -- a result set from this function, given a particular page size
  -- (i.e. the page cutoff occurs within the "block" of identical
  -- timestamps).
