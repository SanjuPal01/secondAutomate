## When Erlang runs on a single CPU system it defaults to disabled SMP
## which breaks some NIF code. In general Delivery should be run on a
## multicore box and this option will not be needed as the Erlang VM
## will enable SMP on multicore boxes by default. However, enabling it
## here will allow the NIF code in question to function on a single
## core box which could be useful for testing.

## Enable kernel poll and a few async threads
