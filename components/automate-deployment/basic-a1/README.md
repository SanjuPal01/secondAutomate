Most of our existing A1 migration setups are based on the all-in-one installs of Automate
1 and the chef-server used by OWCA and in our Amazon Marketplace images. The basic_a1
setup is intended to reflect the typical customer install, with a chef-server on one node
and an Automate installation on another.
