// chef-server-ctl is a FAKE version of Chef Server (omnibus)'s management CLI
// tool. The fake version exists so we can test and demo a1->a2 upgrade
// functionality without setting up a1 over and over. We can also add hooks via
// environment variables to make certain tasks fail which lets us demo the
// failure cases. This is different than the `chef-server-ctl` in the
// automate-cs-nginx package, which provides non-stubbed management
// functionality for the a2 Chef Server integration
