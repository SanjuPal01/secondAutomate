# Dev Docs Readme

The dev-docs folder is home to all the development documentation related directly to A2. Here you
will find documentation related to the architecture of A2, the technology choices of A2, and how to
develop against A2.

## Layout of Dev Docs

Most documentation lives in the root of the dev-docs directory.

- `/images` contains images used in documentation.
- `/diagrams` contains UML diagrams used for reference and in documentation
- `/examples` contains example code

## Additional Dev Docs

Individual services within A2 contain their own documentation. If you don't find documentation that
is helpful in dev-docs, check the service.

Find the service you want to work with in the `/components` directory. If it has a readme file, read
that and check for the existence of a `/docs` directory. If you still can't find what you're looking
for, consider adding the missing docs once you have learned the information.

## Adding to dev-docs

You are free to add to dev-docs as needed. The only way documentation remains relevant and up-to-date
is if you update it when you find something needs updating and add to it when you find something needs
to be added. Treat updating docs as you would any other piece of code - change them, open a PR, and
after review merge it.
